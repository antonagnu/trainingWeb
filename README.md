# Running manager
I am creating this Python & Flask web to manage my personal running information.

The web let you create a new running activity manually, using a gpx file or connecting to the Strava API

Once you have inserted the first activity into the data base then you have access to stadistics, graphs and much more


# How to run the webApp?

Create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies provided in the requirements.txt file

> pip3 install virtualenv

> virtualenv runningweb

> source runningweb/bin/activate

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

> python3 app.py


Now go to http://localhost:5000/
